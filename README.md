# Machine Learning Classifer Analysis for Fetal State Assessment

- Developed a classification model using Cardiotocography dataset to assess fetal well-being and signs of distress

- Cardiotocography (CTG) is the widely used tool for recording fetal heart rate (FHR) signal and uterine contraction (UC) activity at the same time during pregnancy and delivery.

- This dataset contains 2127 records, each of which consists of 35 interger, 2 decimal, 2 string and 1 other features extracted from FHR recordings, as well as the corresponding fetal state class label. The features include baseline FHR, accelerations, decelerations, and variability measures, as well as features derived from the frequency domain analysis of the FHR signal.
